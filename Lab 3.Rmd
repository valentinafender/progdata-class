This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
# 1.1
Use filter() to subset the gapminder data to three countries of your choice in the 1970’s.
```{r}
gapminder |>
  filter(country %in% c("Mali", "China", "Sudan")  & year > 1969 & year < 1979)
```

# 1.2
Start with the original gapminder data and use the pipe operator |> to first do the above filter and then select the “country” and “gdpPercap” variables.
```{r}
gapminder |>
  select(country, gdpPercap, year) |>
  filter(country %in% c("Mali", "China", "Sudan")  & year > 1969 & year < 1979)
```

# 1.3
Make a new variable in gapminder for the change in life expectancy from the previous measurement for that country. Filter this table to show all of the entries that have experienced a drop in life expectancy. Save this result as a new object.

```{r}
gapminder |>
  select(country, lifeExp) |>
  filter(country %in% c("Mali"))|>
  mutate(droplifeExp = lifeExp - lag(lifeExp))
```
## Hint: you might find the lag() or diff() functions useful.
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# 1.4
Filter gapminder so that it shows the max GDP per capita experienced by each country.

```{r}
gapminder |>
  group_by(country) |>
  summarize(max_GDP = max(gdpPercap))
```


## Hint: you might find the max() function useful here.


# 1.5
Produce a scatterplot of Canada’s life expectancy vs. GDP per capita using ggplot2.
In your plot, put GDP per capita on a log scale.


```{r}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  aes(x = lifeExp, y = gdpPercap) + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(
    name = "canada life exp",
    trans = "log10")
```
